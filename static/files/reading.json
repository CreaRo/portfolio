I really enjoyed it because it read like a fiction book - based entirely on one man's recollection of his life events. And that's where I'd like to underscore the thing that stood out the most to me - much like a fiction book, the author is always _right_, because it is his story and he is the protagonist - given no matter what hardship, he comes out on top victorious. However, there are parts in the book where he says he hasn't done anything wrong/illegal, and yet you feel he isn't painting the entire picture. All in all though, this was a great motivational read!",

        "review": "Written in the 1920s when humans did not have the slightest clue of the upcoming digital age, this was the first appearance of a cyborg in literature. What I loved is how one of the most advanced pieces of technology we had in that day was the mechanical clock; and that's as far as the mind's imagination could go - the clockwork man is a cyborg who functions on advanced mechanical machinery, and the key to his functioning is a complicated clock at the back of its head (!!). The book feels like a lifetime compilation of the author's take on the various aspects of life, science and speculation of the future; the book has references to the greatness of Einstein, the understanding of time, the dimensions, love, emotions, relationships, scepticism, and belief. I loved it, and will definitely read this again as a book.",

I enjoyed this book for the very reason that not a lot happens; it really is just about an old man and a large fish; the everyday thoughts one has captured just as one would think them, the loneliness of life, the comradery of ones own company, the relationships we build inside our heads with things both conscious and inanimate.",

This is a quick 100 page simple introduction of the questions philosophy asks - things I've been thinking about all my life.

The advice in the book is not bad per se - it advocates working on yourself, your body, your wardrobe, your knowledge. But the idea of *getting* girls was still a major part of the book that really made me realize how cheap that sounds. I've never had such relationships before. They've always been built on months of getting to know each other and that's what I value."
